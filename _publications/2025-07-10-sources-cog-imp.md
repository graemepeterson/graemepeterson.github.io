excerpt: 'The age-sex adjusted prevalence of dementia in the United States has declined by more than 30% since 2000. However, the underlying sources of this cognitive improvement remain unclear, in part because the etiology of cognitive decline is not well understood. In this paper, we study these patterns, focusing on two commonly hypothesized contributors to cognitive function: air pollution and education. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and quasi-experimental designs, we assess the importance of air pollution and education for improvements in cognitive function since 2000. To form exogenous measures of exposure to small particulate matter (PM2.5), we leverage plausibly exogenous changes in power plant emissions. We instrument for educational attainment by digitizing historical data on the timing of university openings across states. We find that both pollution and education affect cognition. A 1 standard deviation increase in same-year PM2.5 increases the probability of dementia by approximately 0.05 standard deviations (17% of the sample mean). An additional year of education decreases the probability of dementia by approximately 0.1 standard deviations (26% of the sample mean). These effects grow monotonically with age but show little systematic pattern by individuals’ genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease. All else equal, we find that dementia rates are 25% lower than they would have been without these changes.'
