#excerpt: 'Rising life expectancy in the U.S. has focused considerable attention on the possibility of widespread increases in the population with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (ADRD). At the same time, however, the age-sex-adjusted prevalence of ADRD fell by more than 30% from 2000-2016. These patterns have competing implications for the evolution of years lived with dementia. In this paper, we combine data on dementia prevalence from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with life table data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to estimate changes in dementia and dementia-free life expectancy at 65. From 2000-2016, total life expectancy at age 65 for the average American increased by approximately 1.6 years. Nearly all of this increase was driven by increases in dementia-free life years; we find substantively small and statistically insignificant changes in life expectancy with dementia at 65 since 2000. Both patterns persist across all racial and ethnic subgroups that we study. Our results indicate that as Americans are living longer, the additional years are cognitively healthy.'
