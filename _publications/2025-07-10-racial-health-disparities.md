excerpt: 'Disparities between Black and White Americans in health care coverage and health outcomes are pervasive in the United States. In this paper, we describe the evolution of the market-based approach to health insurance and health care delivery in the United States and its implications for racial disparities. First, we discuss the history of the United Statesâ€™ predominantly private health insurance system. Second, we illustrate the persistence and pervasiveness of disparities through three present-day epidemics: maternal mortality, opioid use, and Covid-19. Through the epidemic case studies, we highlight the systemic roots of racial inequality in health care. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion of potential policy approaches for reducing disparities in the health care system.'
