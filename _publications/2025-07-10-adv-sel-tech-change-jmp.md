excerpt: 'New medical technologies are increasingly expensive. Innovation of this kind makes generous health insurance coverage more valuable for those at risk of needing a new therapy. However, if those individuals are costlier to insure, then innovation may also generate adverse selection, making generous coverage harder for the market to sustain. I develop a conceptual framework to study this trade-off and examine it empirically using data from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug insurance program for the elderly. I first provide reduced-form evidence that an innovation shock driven by high-cost new drug approvals in the mid-2010s generated substantial adverse selection against generous Part D plans, increasing average costs by 35% and premiums by 52%. In the years following the shock, the market exhibits hallmark patterns of unraveling: switchers into generous coverage are high-cost and more likely to use new drugs; switchers out are disproportionately low-cost as premiums rise; and, within four years, 56% of generous plans have exited the market. I complement these reduced-form results with estimates from a structural model of plan choice that allows me to measure changes in selection and welfare directly. Using a sufficient statistics approach, I show that adverse selection against generous coverage more than doubles following the innovation shock, with particularly sharp changes in selection among those who use the new prescription drugs. These results underscore the potential for technological change to unravel insurance markets and highlight the need for policies that stabilize these markets as high-cost new medical technologies continue to proliferate.'
