excerpt: "New medical technologies – from GLP-1s to novel treatments for Alzheimer’s disease – are increasingly expensive. These high-cost innovations make generous health insurance more valuable for individuals at risk of needing new therapies. However, if those individuals are also costlier to insure, innovation may generate adverse selection. I develop a conceptual framework to study this trade-off and examine it empirically using data from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug insurance program for the elderly. I first show that an innovation shock driven by high-cost new drug approvals in the mid-2010s generated adverse selection against plans with generous coverage for the new drugs, increasing their average costs by 35%. In the years following the shock, the market exhibits hallmark patterns of dynamic adverse selection: switchers into generous coverage are high-cost and more likely to use new drugs; premiums rise by 52%; and price sensitive low-cost enrollees switch out of generous plans. Ultimately, the market partially unravels, as the market share for the generous plans falls by 50%. This unraveling reduces equilibrium social surplus in the post-innovation period by 64% relative to the ex-ante efficient coverage level. Part D’s generous reinsurance limits these losses; with a less generous reinsurance policy, the market unravels completely. These results underscore the importance of such policies for stabilizing insurance markets as high-cost new medical innovation continues to accelerate."
