excerpt: 'New medical technologies are increasingly expensive. High-cost innovations make generous health insurance coverage more valuable for individuals at risk of needing new therapies. However, if those individuals are also costlier to insure, innovation may generate adverse selection. I develop a conceptual framework to study this trade-off and examine it empirically using data from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug insurance program for the elderly. I first provide evidence that an innovation shock driven by high-cost new drug approvals in the mid-2010s generated adverse selection against more generous Part D plans providing additional coverage for those drugs in the ‘donut hole,’ increasing average costs for such plans by 35%. In the years following the shock, the market exhibits hallmark patterns of dynamic adverse selection, as switchers into generous coverage are high-cost and more likely to use new drugs. In response to these patterns, premiums rise by 52%, driving out low-cost enrollees, and the market partially unravels, as the market share for the generous plans falls by 50%. I use a structural model of plan choice to decompose these changes in selection and estimate the welfare costs of this unraveling. Approximately 85% of the increase in selection is driven by two forces: increases in willingness-to-pay for generous coverage among those with high costs at baseline (standard adverse selection) and increases in willingness-to-pay among those whose costs increase substantially (selection on moral hazard). These results underscore the potential for technological change to unravel insurance markets and highlight the need for policies that stabilize these markets as high-cost new medical technologies continue to proliferate.'
